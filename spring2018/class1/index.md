Web Mapping **Quick Start**

Hi! I'm Dan. You can reach me at <a href='https://twitter.com/danswick'>@danswick</a> or <strong>dan.swick@gmail.com</strong>.

--- 

I used to do _GIS_ in the environmental NGO world and city government. Now I work at **Mapbox**!

---

**Who** are you?
**Why** are you here?

---

**This course** is about what _you_ want to learn. 

--- 

But the **goals** and **objectives** of this course remain the _same_ regardless. By the end you should:

---

Be able to _think critically_ about web maps.

---

_Understand_ how web maps are **built**. 

---

Have the _vocabulary_ to talk about web maps (not to mention **search** for the things you need!). 

--- 

Feel _confident_ and _stoked_ about what you've accomplished!
