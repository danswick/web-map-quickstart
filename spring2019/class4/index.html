  </p></div>
  <div>Let's recap <em>homework</em>:
    <ul>
      <li><em>Show and tell!</em> Which GL JS tutorial did you follow? How did it go? <strong>Show us!</strong></li>
      <li>Go through some D3 tutorials. Did you make anything cool?</li>
      <li>For your class journal: What are events? How has web map rendering changed over the years? What is the basemap-overlay paradigm and how are GL maps different?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Today's class is a <strong>crash course</strong> in <em>D3</em>.</div>
  <div>Today we're going to <em>blaze through</em> a lot of information about D3. It's <em>a lot</em> and I don't want you to get discouraged if you feel like it's hard to absorb in one sitting.</div>
  <div>As always, the <strong>goal of this class</strong> is to give you the <em>tools you need</em> to <strong>find answers and think critically</strong>.</div>
  <div>Pay attention to terminology and concepts, but <em>don't worry if you dont' get everything that's going on in the code</em>. There's always time to go back and look more closely later.</div>
  <div>The best way to learn this stuff is <em>to practice!</em></div>
  <div>ðŸ’ª YOU GOT THIS</div>
  <div>Today, we're going to be using a new tool to explore code: <em>Observable</em>.</div>
  <div>Observable is for making <em>JavaScript notebooks</em>, which are <strong>interactive documents</strong> that let you embed working code among explanatory text.</div>
  <div>If you'd like, <em>go ahead and sign up</em> at <strong>https://observablehq.com</strong>, but you can follow along without an account as well.</div>
  <div>Head to <a href="https://observablehq.com/@danswick/dog-pictures">https://observablehq.com/@danswick/dog-pictures</a> and we'll do a quick tour of the interface.</div>
  <div>NICE</div>
  <div>For the rest of the class, we're going to be heads-down in some Observable notebooks. Here they are:<ul>
    <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@danswick/intro-to-d3-a-man-walks-into-a-barchart">Intro to D3 part 1: a man walks into a barchart</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@danswick/intro-to-d3-part-2-putting-d3-on-the-map">Intro to D3 part 2: putting D3 on the map</a></li>
  </ul></div>
  <div><em>HOLY CARPS, Y'ALL!</em> That's awesome!</div>
  <div>You <strong>totally kicked butt</strong> today. <em>Pat yourself on the back.</em></div>
  <div>Keep playing! <strong>Keep making stuff!</strong> It just gets <em>more fun</em>!</div>
